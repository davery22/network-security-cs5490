# Class Project -- Radio Window Attack Investigation
For the class project, a couple classmates (Alemayehu Abrar, Radha Jaguvakannan) and I collected samples for a version of the Radio Window Attack (can't find a good paper to link to - basically this attack uses observed perturbances in the signal between a transmitter and attacker receiver to infer physical information within an unauthorized area).

We had different numbers of volunteers walk randomly around a room with a transmitter in it, while receivers on the outside periodically recorded Received Signal Strength (RSS). We then used two methods to estimate the number of people, based only on the RSS measurements over time. The first was based on prior research into expected characteristics of the probability distribution functions of the RSS. The second (which I worked on, for the sake of comparison against the first approach) was a machine learning idea, which attempts to predict the number of people by splitting the data into short labeled intervals, training on some of them, and then testing against the rest. The code for that simple experiment lives here.
